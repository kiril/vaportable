VaporTable
===========

VaporTable is a tiny framework for using a subset of SQL to access arbitrary Python code,
in a controlled, secure, and decoupled way.  It's not as crazy as it sounds.  It gives
a nice layer of simple-to-use abstraction into querying a system.  People know SQL, which
makes it easy to learn.  Be able to change the representation of underlying data really
easily, and leave the query interface intact.

You could:
* limit SQL that can be run against a given database by end-users
* allow arbitrary SQL, but run 'explain' before each query is run to prevent performance
  problems
* build an SQL-like interface into an in-memory data structure

Anyway, it is what you make it. :)



A couple of implementations at this point, which demonstrate potential:

1) vdjango.py - Using VQL to access Django models.  Not as backward as it sounds.
2) vsql.py - Build models that translate VQL into SQL, but restrict and translate
             access to columns, queryability, etc.

Requirements
============
* Python 2.5+ (likely works earlier)
* pyparsing (sweet little DSL for creating parsers)
* Django, if you want to use vdjango
